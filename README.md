[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)

### Student Info

-   Name: Reva Sathe
-   Section: 02

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: My assets will be veiwed from the side, similar to mario or other side scrolling games. 
-   Camera Movement: The camera will stay static.
-   Player Health:I plan to impliment a health bar with a max health value of 100, though different monsters you collide with will detract a unique amount of health depending on their type.
-   End Condition: The game ends either by getting hit enough to where your health is 0 or by defeating a certain number of monsters, this number has yet to be determined.
-   Scoring: Points are earned by successfully killing monsters.

### Game Description

_A brief explanation of your game. Inculde what is the objective for the player. Think about what would go on the back of a game box._
This game is a simple shoot em up game similar to asteroids where you play as Dannie(name subject to change) as she fights off waves of mosnters using power purely made up of spite.

### Controls

-   Movement
    -   Up: up arrow key/'w' key
    -   Down: down arrow key/'s' key
    -   Left: left arrow key/'a' key
    -   Right: right arrow key/'d' key
-   Fire: space bar

## You Additions/Makt it my own

All visual assets other than the UI are hand drawn by me, this includes the player sprite, all three monster sprites, player bullets, and the background. Another aspect of uniqueness is a high level monster that has the ability to instantly kill the player as well as reward a large amount of points. This is in addition to the two required enemies that the player fights against.

## Sources

-   _List all project sources here –models, textures, sound clips, assets, etc._
-   _If an asset is from the Unity store, include a link to the page and the author’s name_

## Known Issues

As of checkpoint 3 I have noticed that my collisions with the enemy tend to get buggy the longer the program runs, this is something that I am working on fixing though the cause of this error is unknown as of right now.
