[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)

### Student Info

-   Name: Reva Sathe
-   Section: 02

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: My assets will be veiwed from the side, similar to mario or other side scrolling games. 
-   Camera Movement: The camera will stay static.
-   Player Health:I plan to impliment a health bar with a max health value of 100, though different monsters you collide with will detract a unique amount of health depending on their type.
-   End Condition: The game ends either by getting hit enough to where your health is 0 or by defeating a certain number of monsters, this number has yet to be determined.
-   Scoring: Points are earned by successfully killing monsters.

### Game Description

_A brief explanation of your game. Inculde what is the objective for the player. Think about what would go on the back of a game box._
This game is a simple shoot em up game similar to asteroids where you play as Dannie(name subject to change) as she fights off waves of mosnters using power purely made up of spite.

### Controls

-   Movement
    -   Up: 
    -   Down: 
    -   Left: 
    -   Right: 
-   Fire: 

## You Additions

For this game I plan to hand draw all the sprites as well as a background. I also plan to impliment a sort of power up that is dependent on the amount of time that has passed in order to use it that will make battling monsters easier until it runs out. 

## Sources

-   _List all project sources here –models, textures, sound clips, assets, etc._
-   _If an asset is from the Unity store, include a link to the page and the author’s name_

## Known Issues

As of checkpoint 3 I have noticed that my collisions with the enemy tend to get buggy the longer the program runs, this is something that I am working on fixing though the cause of this error is unknown as of right now.

### Requirements not completed
