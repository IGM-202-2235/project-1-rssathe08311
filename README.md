## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: The camera is positioned to display the game environment as a flat, horizontal plane from left to right.
-   Camera Movement: The camera will stay static, while enemies will move onto the screen.
-   Player Health: Health is represented by a health bar with a maximum value of 100, through colliding with different monsters a different amount of health will be detracted from the max until your health is at 0 which then will cause the game to end.
-   End Condition: The only way to end the game is by getting hit by enough monsters to where your health is 0 or lower.
-   Scoring: You are able to score points by killing the different monsters, different monsters are worth different amounts of points. The smallest monsters are worth 10 points, the larger ones are worth 15 points, and then the largest monsters are worth 100 points.

## You Additions/Makt it my own

All visual assets other than the UI are hand drawn by me, this includes the player sprite, all three monster sprites, player bullets, and the background. Another aspect of uniqueness is a high level monster that has the ability to instantly kill the player as well as reward a large amount of points. This is in addition to the two required enemies that the player fights against.
